<h2>ML project -> comparison of two faces (images) - Face Verification</h2>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Target of this project is to create Face Verification with input of two face images. Machine Learning predictive model is 
a Support Vector Machine model. 

<h3>Training dataset (face dataset)</h3>
A training dataset of images of 100 perdon is the kaggle dataset:
